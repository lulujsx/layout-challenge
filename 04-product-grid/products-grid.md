# Product grid ðŸ’»
A Product Grid is a listing of products. This grid can be found mostly in the product listings of the categories.

## Exercise ðŸ“¢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the design of the proposed Product Grid. To do this we want to see how you perform in the use of HTML and CSS. The CTAs of the products must have the entire product card and be at https://www.lop.global and open in a new window.

The folder structure can be the one you think is most convenient. **We only ask that it be within a "dev" folder within this same "Product Grid" folder.**

### Mobile version
For the mobile version, the products have to be displayed in 2 columns and 4 rows.
