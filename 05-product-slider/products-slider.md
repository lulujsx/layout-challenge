# Products slider ðŸ’»
A Product Slider is a listing of products. This block can be found mostly on the home page and product page where additional products are recommended.

## Exercise ðŸ“¢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the design of the proposed Product Slider. To do this, we want to see how you perform in the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript and the use of libraries. For this we ask you to use the [slick library](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/). The CTAs of the products must have the entire product card and be at https://www.lop.global and open in a new window.

The folder structure can be whatever you think is most convenient. **We only ask that it be within a "dev" folder within this same "Product Slider" folder.**

### Mobile version
For the mobile version, the products must be shown 2 products per row and with a higher title. The product slider should show your arrows and dots.
