# Product page ðŸ’»
A Product description page is the product itself, where you can see the specific details of the product and add the product to the cart.

## Exercise ðŸ“¢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the design of the proposed product page. For this we want to see how you perform in the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript. The CTA of the add to cart button must be to https://www.lop.global and open in a new window.

For this last exercise we ask you to add the header and footer made in exercises 01 and 02 to the page.

The folder structure can be the one you think is most convenient. **We only ask that it be within a "dev" folder within this same "Product Page" folder.**
