# Header ðŸ’»
The header is the top part of the web pages of a site. In an eCommerce, in the header you will find the brand logo, the navigation menu, the search engine, access to your account and shopping cart and other links with access to different pages of the site.

## Exercise ðŸ“¢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the design of the proposed header. To do this we want to see how you perform in the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript. The menu links must be to https://www.lop.global and open in a new window.

The folder structure can be the one you think is most convenient. **We only ask that it be inside a "dev" folder within this same "header" folder.**

### Mobile version
For the mobile version, the menu has a single level when you tap on the hamburger menu
