# Footer ðŸ’»
The Footer is the bottom part of a site's web pages. In an eCommerce, in the Footer you will find the brand logo, the navigation menu to different sections of the site, registration for the brand's newsletter and access to social networks.

## Exercise ðŸ“¢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the design of the proposed Footer. To do this we want to see how you perform in the use of HTML, CSS and Javascript. The menu links must be to https://www.lop.global and open in a new window.

The folder structure can be the one you think is most convenient. **We only ask that it be inside a "dev" folder within this same "Footer" folder.**

### Mobile version
For the mobile version, the menus work with an accordion. In order to see the second level it is necessary to touch the first level, it is displayed
