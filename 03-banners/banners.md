# Banner ðŸ’»
A banner, or more formally web banner, is an advertising format on the Internet. It is a type of advertisement that is generally used in so-called display advertising, advertising pieces with graphic content that are located on different web pages. There are different formats for both desktop and mobile sizes.

## Exercise ðŸ“¢
The objective of the exercise is to replicate the design of the proposed Banner. To do this, we want to see how you perform in the use of HTML, CSS, Javascript and the use of libraries. Banner CTAs must be to https://www.lop.global and open in a new window.

The folder structure can be whatever you think is most convenient. **We only ask that it be inside a "dev" folder within this same "Banner" folder.**

### Mobile version
For the mobile version, in the first grid, 3 banners must be placed and they work with a slider. For this we ask you to use the [slick library](https://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/). For the second row, there are 2 still images, one below the other.

### Desktop version
In the desktop version, they are still images without a slider. There are 2 rows composed of a first row with 2 images and a second row composed of 3 images.
